# 🧬 Phytochemical and Antioxidant Analysis of the Brown Seaweed Turbinaria conoides

This repository contains the full research methodology, experimental datasets, results, and final thesis manuscript from my undergraduate group project titled:

📘 “Phytochemical Screening and Evaluation of Antioxidant Potential of Turbinaria conoides Collected from Southeast Coastal India.”

This project aims to explore the phytochemical richness and antioxidant capabilities of Turbinaria conoides, a commonly found brown marine seaweed, through both qualitative and quantitative laboratory assays. The study identifies major bioactive compounds and evaluates their potential applications in nutraceutical and therapeutic development.

## 🧪 Abstract

Turbinaria conoides is a brown macroalga widely distributed along the tropical and subtropical coasts. Marine algae are increasingly recognized for their bioactive compounds, particularly antioxidants that combat oxidative stress in biological systems. In this study, ethanolic extracts of T. conoides were analyzed for the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, and other phytochemicals using both preliminary screening and quantitative estimations. Antioxidant potential was determined through DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays. Additionally, Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to identify the primary phytoconstituents. Our findings support the therapeutic potential of T. conoides as a rich source of antioxidant compounds for use in functional foods or pharmaceutical formulations.
